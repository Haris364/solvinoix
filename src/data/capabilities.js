/**
 * CAPABILITIES — how the solutions get built.
 *
 * This file answers a different question from `solutions.js`:
 *
 *   solutions.js      "What does the business need, and what would removing
 *                      that loss require?"
 *   capabilities.js   "How would we build it, and what does the client receive?"
 *
 * The two are never merged. Technology names live at the end of each entry as
 * supporting detail, because a capability is defined by its practice and
 * deliverables, not by a list of frameworks.
 *
 * Fields
 *   id            URL segment
 *   number        01–05
 *   title         capability name
 *   summary       one line
 *   practice      what the discipline covers, in engineering terms
 *   deliverables  what the client actually receives
 *   standards     the commitments that make the work maintainable
 *   technologies  supporting, shown last
 *   relatedSolutions
 *                  ids from solutions.js, used only to answer "where is this
 *                  actually applied?" at the foot of the page. The two datasets
 *                  stay separate everywhere else.
